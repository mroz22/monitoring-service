# monitoring-service
A simple service that allows you to monitor remote endpoints and list results. 
Monitored endpoints are expected to return their **payloads as JSON.**

## requirements 
docker v 17.04.0+. to check version, run 
```
$ docker -v

## how to run it

Clone this repo.

Go to .env.example file and create .env.development and 
.env.test file. 

Prepare containers as defined in docker-compose.yml, 
this might take a while.
```
$ docker-compose build
```
Run your containers with this command. Now you should 
be able to access monitoring-service on port 3000.

```
$ docker-compose up
```

You might want to run containers in detached mode (on background).
To accomplish this run:

```
$ docker-compose up -d 
```

To get an interactive prompt, you can run  

```
$ docker-compose exec monitoring-service sh
```

Voil√°, npm commands are now accessible.

## API

## authentication
